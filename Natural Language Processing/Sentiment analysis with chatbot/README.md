# sentiment-analysis-with-chatbot

## Introduction

Communicating with customers through live chat interfaces is widely used these days. Especially if a certain company has a large number of customers. To handle this massive number of the company's customers the company needs the help of an AI solution ("Chat Bot") because it has a real-time response. For example a customer wants to ask a question (e.g., product details) or the customer needs help(e.g., solving technical problems).  With The massive expansion of the internet most people tend to use the internet in almost everything. But there is an issue that may occur while using the chatbots where the Bot does not fulfill the customer needs this will make the customer frustrated and make the company lose the customer. That may make a big loss for the company. There must be a way to find the Chatbot user satisfaction while using the chatbot. So we found an idea to ask the user about his opinion in the new system and make sentiment analysis to the customer's review. That will make the company find if the customer is satisfied with the Bot or the company or not. And to detect what are the reasons that make the customer unhappy.
